![A simple spectral noise optimization example using SNR method](../imgs/MLNoiseOptimization/simpleeg.png)

SNR (Signal-to-noise ratio) is a widely used sclae in science and engineering field to compare the strength of desired signal with the strength of the background noise. In practical application, havung a larger SNR means tha the data is more reliable.

```
SNR = signal / noise
```

### The Beer-Lambert Law


### The Interferometry
